# ONEST Network Documentation

**Open Network for Education and Skilling Transaction (ONEST)** fosters a fair and accessible network that is both open and decentralized, allowing individuals and organizations to harness its power to unlock their full potential, facilitating access to learning and livelihood opportunities.

The objective of setting up ONEST is to break the current siloed ecosystem where the education & content providers, education facilitators, education seekers, education facilitators & job providers operate in a fragmented and secluded manner which restricts collaborations that could have otherwise flourished into business & social partnerships aiming towards the same goal of “**equitable education** & skilling to **enhance employability** and **sustainable livelihood**.” &#x20;

### What will ONEST enable?

ONEST will enable B2B & B2C discovery and transactions and will help address the needs of service providers as well as service consumers in the education and job ecosystem by establishing platform-agnostic interoperability on the same analogy of UPI. Organizations and individuals will also be able to broadcast their services & content facilitating a democratic and informed approach facilitating “freedom of choice” to end consumers select the services from a surplus pool of providers of their choice as per their preferences in terms of services, location, and affordability.  The initiative also envisages a mechanism to identify each other uniquely, trust each other, and store their credentials including proof of work in machine-readable formats which are portable and verifiable across different tenets, to help them build reputation and credibility.
