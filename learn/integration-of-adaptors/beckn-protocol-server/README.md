# Beckn Protocol Server

## Introduction

Protocol Server is a service that helps the application connect to ONEST Network. It follows the [Beckn Protocol](https://beckn.network/protocol) and makes it more accessible for the applications to get started quickly. Any network participant can run this server and connect to ONEST Network.

## Features

* Connects a client application with the ONEST network.
* Acts as BAP Adaptor in case of Beckn Application Platform.
* Acts as BPP Adaptor in case of Beckn Provider Platform.
* Validates each request as per the Beckn Networkâ€™s Open API schema.
* Generates signatures for the outgoing requests and validates signatures for the incoming requests.
* Stores log for each process.
* Comes with key generation scripts for the Network participants.

## Architecture

There would 2 instances of Protocol Server that is running. One is `Client` facing and the other is `Network` facing.\
\
**In the case of BAP**\
\
`Client` facing Protocol Server manages building the context, validating the request body as per the Standard Beckn Open API schema, listens to the Message Queue, Aggregates the results in the case of Synchronous mode and forwards the results to the client side application as a webhook callback.

`Network` facing Protocol Server manages forwarding the request to the respective Participant or Beckn Gateway (BG). Also it validates the incoming requests from Participants & BG as per the Standard Beckn Open API schema and then validates the signature sent from the clients to ensure the data integrity.

**In the case of BPP**\
\
`Client` facing Protocol Server listens to the Message Queue and forwards the request to client side application, exposes an endpoint where the client side application can send the results to the network which is again validated against the Standard Beckn Open API schema and pushed to the network facing Protocol Server.

`Network` facing Protocol Server also listens to the Message Queue and forwards the request to the respective Participant or BG. Also it validates the incoming requests from Participants & BG as per the Standard Beckn Open API schema and then validates the signature sent from the clients to ensure the data integrity.

## Installation

* Docker version 20.10 or above ([docker-installation.md](docker-installation.md "mention"))

### Download

As the Protocol Server repository is Public, clone the repository and checkout to master branch.\
\
[Repository Link](https://github.com/ONEST-Network/protocol-server)

```
1. git clone https://github.com/ONEST-Network/protocol-server.git
2. git checkout master
3. cd protocol-server
```

### Install

You can utilize Docker to deploy the MongoDB, RabbitMQ and Redis services. We've included an illustrative docker-compose file located in `docker/docker-compose.yaml`.

To set things up effortlessly, run the `setup.sh` command. This command not only copies the Follow file to your home directory but also generates a `docker_data` directory. Within this directory, you'll find the `docker-compose.yaml` file for configuring the aforementioned services.

Additionally, here's a list of files included for your reference:

* `deploy-bap.sh`
* `deploy-bpp.sh`
* `default-bap-client.yml`
* `default-bap-network.yml`
* `default-bpp-client.yml`
* `default-bpp-network.yml`

Feel free to explore and use these resources as needed for your setup.

Please set the user name and password as per requirement in docker-compose.yaml file inside docker\_data directory.

```
bash setup.sh
```

Go to docker\_data directory and run the below command to start redis, rabbit-mq and mongo-db containers.

```
docker-compose up -d
```

### Update Configuration Files which we have copied to home directory

*   In the BAP Client and BAP Network codebases, update the `~/default-bap-client.yml` and `~/default-bap-network.yml` file with the following values:

    * Private Key: Copy the private key of your participant.
    * Public Key: Copy the public key of your participant.
    *   Use the Registry  lookup API to get the `subscriber id`, `subscriber url` and `unique key` .



        ```
        curl --location 'https://sandbox.onest.network/onest/lookup' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
            "country": "IND",
            "type":"BAP"
        }'
        ```



    * Subscriber ID: Get using registry lookup API
    * Subscriber URI: Get using registry lookup API
    * Unique Key: Get using registry lookup API
    * Registry URL: `https://sandbox.onest.network/onest`
*   In the BPP Client and BPP Network codebases, update the `~/default-bpp-client.yml` and `~/default-bpp-network.yml` file with the following values:

    * Private Key: Copy the private key of your participant.
    * Public Key: Copy the public key of your participant.
    *   Use the Registry  lookup API to get the `subscriber id`, `subscriber url` and `unique key`.



        ```
        curl --location 'https://sandbox.onest.network/onest/lookup' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
            "country": "IND",
            "type":"BPP"
        }'
        ```



    * Subscriber ID: Get using registry lookup API
    * Subscriber URI: Get using registry lookup API
    * Unique Key: Get using registry lookup API
    * Registry URL: `https://sandbox.onest.network/onest`
    * WebhookURL: The endpoint URL of your service the hosts protocol APIs like search, on\_search etc.

### Run

#### Docker Deployment

Execute `~/deploy-bap.sh` file to deploy the the BAP Client and Network.

Execute `~/deploy-bpp.sh` file to deploy the the BPP Client and Network.

#### PM2 Deployment

For PM2 deployment you need to git clone protocol-server four times to setup the BAP Client and Network and BPP Client and Network. Then copy `~/default-bap-client.yml` and `~/default-bap-network.yml` to config directory in respective git clone directory of BAP Client and Network. Also copy `~/default-bpp-client.yml` and `~/default-bpp-network.yml` to config directory in respective git clone directory of BPP Client and Network.

After configuration, Protocol Server can be run as below.

To run the instance in Development Mode (For Debug Purposes):

```
npm run dev
```

To run the instance in Production Mode:

```
npm i -g pm2
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

## Exposing local Protocol-server to Internet

### Setting up LocalTunnel when there is no DNS tool available

Note: use this when you dont have any DNS URLS to assign

1. Install localtunnel globally using `npm install -g localtunnel`.
2. Run `lt --port <BAP/BPP network port> --subdomain <any subdomain>` for both BAP and BPP networks (use the same subdomain each time for consistency). \[Example: `lt --port 5001 --subdomain beckn-bap-network`]

**Note: Whenever the system or LocalTunnel is restarted the the generated localtunnel DNS will be changed. We have to register the newly generated local-tunnel DNS after restarting in Registry and default.yml files respectively.**

### Nginx in Production System (Ubuntu) if you have DNS Tools

Nginx is used to

1. Update your system: `sudo apt update`.
2. Install Nginx: `sudo apt-get install nginx -y`.
3. Navigate to the Nginx configuration directory: `cd /etc/nginx/conf.d`.
4. Create a new configuration file: `sudo nano {enter-any-name.conf}`. Enter the configuration to map your DNS with the port of BAP/BPP Network\&Client.

**Example Configuration:**

```
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name example.domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        proxy_pass http://localhost:port;
    }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name example.domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        proxy_pass http://localhost:port;
    }

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.domain.com/privkey.pem;

    ssl_session_timeout 1d;
    ssl_session_cache shared:MozSSL:10m;
    ssl_session_tickets off;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-
    ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000" always;

    ssl_stapling on;
    ssl_stapling_verify on;

    resolver 8.8.8.8;
}
```

Replace `example.domain.com` and `port` with your desired values in multiple places.

Obtain an SSL certificate for your domain and configure it on your machine.
