ONEST Protocol layered architecture is illustrated as shown in the diagram below. The base layer refers to the Beckn Protocol, which is an open source decentralized protocol. Over the base layer, the network extension layer comprises the API contracts customized to the ONEST context, along with other specs that have been adopted in order to facilitate transactions in the network.
