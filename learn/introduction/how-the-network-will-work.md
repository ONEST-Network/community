Ever since the dawn of the smartphone era, education, skilling, and jobs have reached the palm of our hands. The last decade has seen a sharp increase in ed-tech platforms offering curated content for various levels of education right from pre-school to advanced degrees.

We have platforms that provide training, platforms that provide online courses, platforms that provide dedicated tutoring and mentoring, platforms where you can discover and apply for scholarships, and last but not least, job portals that list positions offered by various employers.

However, the platform approach, while elegant, cannot solve problems at population scale. This is due to a simple fact that a person’s career is dependent on a multitude of factors like education, skills, credentials, relevant work experience, financial status, and the most important of all, access to relevant information and guidance.

In today’s world of ed-tech platforms and job portals, it is nearly impossible to keep track of all job opportunities, training courses, scholarships, and dedicated tutoring classes and then provide a personalized skilling experience to a person with a career objective.

Another issue is that you can only discover opportunities that are present on platforms, it is impossible to know what is not on the platform

What if we split each of these platforms into two logical blocks? One that acquires only skilling providers, employers, mentors etc and the other that acquires only skilling and education consumers like students, job seekers etc. Now, each platform can operate independently, focusing on the experiences and functionalities required for either the consumer or the provider.

What if we split each of these platforms into two logical blocks and connect all of them via a network? One that acquires only skilling providers, employers, mentors etc and the other that acquires only skilling and education consumers like students, job seekers etc,

Such a network would allow consumers to access courses and training, connect with tutors, mentors and coaches, avail scholarships and grants, and also apply for job and internship listings via a platform of their choice.

Similarly, mentors, coaches, teachers, employers, grants, and scholarship providers will have access to an extremely large consumer base. Such an access can allow them to analyze demand and focus on providing relevant products and services to their target consumers.
