# Introduction

Observability of the ONEST network provides the ability to understand and gain insights into the inner workings of the network by observing its behaviour, performance, and state. Observability provides a range of benefits, including but not limited to:

1. Debugging & Troubleshooting: Observability provides the necessary data and insights to identify & diagnose issues, and determine their root causes. This is crucial for resolving bugs, performance bottlenecks, and other operational problems quickly.
2. Compliance & Auditing: Observability is essential for maintaining compliance with the ONEST protocol, specifications & policies. It provides the necessary data for auditing and reporting purposes.
3. Data-driven Services: Observability provides data-driven insights that can help ONEST evolve its services to help network and the network participants make informed choices based on real-time and historical data.
4. Security: Observability helps in detecting and responding to security threats. Unusual patterns or anomalies in data can be indicators of potential security breaches or threats.

The observability infrastructure within ONEST is designed to offer the following key features:

* Process the incoming data: validate for protocol compliance and mask any PII information present in the input data
* Query the processed data via multiple modes: query API, dashboards (pre-created & ability to create new), and download the ingested data as files from cloud storage

The observability infrastructure and services will be accessible to all network participants, allowing them to harness these resources for various purposes, in accordance with the policies set forth by the ONEST network
